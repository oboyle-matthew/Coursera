### Week 1

Create a Calculator class that has the following methods: 

* int add(int a, int b)
* int subtract(int a, int b)
* int intAverage(int a, int b) - gives the integer average of 2 numbers (ignores the remainder)
* double doubleAverage(int a, int b) - gives the actual average of 2 numbers as a double
* boolean isPositive(int x) - returns a boolean (true/false) stating whether a number is positive or not.
Note: 0 should return false
* void printPositive(int x) - prints whether a number is positive, negative or 0
* boolean isBigger(int a, int b) - returns a boolean representing whether a is bigger than b.
Note: When a == b, it should return false
* void printBigger(int a, int b) - prints whether a is bigger than b, b is bigger than a, or a ==b
* int hypotenuse(int a, int b) - returns the hypotenuse of a triangle given the 2 other sides.
Note: a^2 + b^2 = h^2
* void nestedIf(int x) - Prints if a number is positive/negative and odd/even. 
Note: For 0 should have a special case, as it is neither positive or negative
* ADVANCED: int sumAll(int[] nums) - Given an array of integers, print their sum
* ADVANCED: double averageAll(int[] nums) - Given an array of integers, prints the average
